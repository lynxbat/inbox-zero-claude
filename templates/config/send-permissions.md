# Send Permissions

Configuration for when Claude can auto-send vs. require draft review.

## Default Behavior

**Always ask before sending** - Trust is earned through use.

For every response, Claude will ask:
- "Send now, or open as draft?"

## Auto-Send Rules

*Low-risk response types that can be auto-sent:*

<!-- Rules will be added here as trust is established -->
<!-- Example format:
- FYI acknowledgments ("Thanks for the update")
- Meeting confirmations to internal team
- Simple approvals to direct reports
- Calendar responses (accept/decline)
-->

## Always Draft (Never Auto-Send)

These always require manual review:

- Responses to executives (CEO, VP+)
- External vendor communications
- Anything involving budget/cost/money
- Escalations or bad news
- First-time correspondents
- Legal or HR matters
- Customer-facing communications

## Response Templates

*Pre-approved response patterns:*

<!-- Example:
### Acknowledgment
"Thanks for the update. I'll review and follow up if needed."

### Meeting Accept
"Confirmed - see you then."

### Delegation
"Looping in [name] who can help with this."
-->

## Trust Log

*Record of auto-send rule additions:*

<!-- New permissions will be appended here with date and rationale -->
<!-- Example:
- 2025-01-15: Added "meeting confirmations to team" - low risk, high frequency
- 2025-01-20: Added "FYI acknowledgments" - simple, no commitment
-->
